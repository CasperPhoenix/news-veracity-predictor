# news-veracity-predictor
A news website that utilizes a news API and advanced machine learning technology to provide accurate and trustworthy news to its users.

One of the key features of our website is its ability to predict the veracity of news articles using a BERT model that has been fine-tuned with a fake news dataset. This means that our users can be confident that they are receiving credible information, and can trust our website to deliver accurate news.

In addition, we have also implemented a translation feature that allows users to read news articles in their preferred language. As a student, I know the value of learning and staying informed, and our translation feature makes it easy for users to access news content in any language they choose.

Overall, our project aims to help individuals stay informed and educated on the latest news and events happening around the world. As a student, I am proud to have developed a project that promotes the importance of trustworthy news sources and language accessibility.
